## About JoJoBot
JoJoBot is discord bot made with pycord that I decided to create ages ago. It went through many revisions in my early days of programming, but now I've finally learned enough about Object-Oriented Programming to create a readable, extensible and fast version of this project.

I'm excited to launch this when it is ready so, for tracking's sake, I'm going to upload my development to this git repository to keep track of where I'm at and also to move the code between machines, which I often find myself needing to do.
